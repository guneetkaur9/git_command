1. git clone
To create a local working copy of an existing remote repository, use git clone to copy and download the repository to a computer. Cloning is the equivalent of git init when working with a remote repository. Git will create a directory locally with all files and repository history.
usage :
git clone <remote_URL>

2. git push
Sends local commits to the remote repository. git push requires two parameters: the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.

Usage:

$ git push <remote_URL/remote_name> <branch>

# Push all local branches to remote repository
$ git push —all
